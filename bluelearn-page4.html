            I always wanted to learn UI design but due to a lack of motivation, I was constantly procrastinating.
             But thanks to the team Bluelearn for organising this Designathon event where we had to form a team and 
             solve a problem with our design skills.

              you can find a motivated team there.<br/><br/><b>Ayush Mittal</b>

            Studying doesn't have to be a lonely activity. The study streak club was a great example of that. 
            Studying with friends gives the motivation that nothing else can.

            Bluelearn is helping thousands of students get jobs, or internships that no other platform is doing.
            I have applied a hundred of jobs on other platforms but i did not even get any respond.
             But Bluelearn makes me feel home.
             It connects. It inspires. It helps other to grows.

            Hey, I've been using Bluelearn and it has been amazing.
             I was able to find a nice video editing internship at a good company so that I could grow in my field of work and prosper. 
             I couldn't have done it without Bluelearn
